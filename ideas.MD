things to implement:

- consider discarding image tensors with nans in them rather than just setting to 0.
- update README with better instructions for local setup
- if model is not good at inferring, considering training on images with background replacement of comomon home office backgroudns ( from the POV of a webcam user)
- Recopy PalmPilot ( and maybe PalmPilot_Data ) to relieve root user permission from many files
